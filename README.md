# CTD processing mini-workshop

Repository for preparing the CTD workshop.

## Notes to self:

- Have installation instructions ready in advance!
- Quick intro presentation:
    - Basic rationale
    - Tools (python, jupyter, oceanograpy) - quick!
    - Example (quick)
- Need a *template* including a folder structure
- Have *workshop notes* on hav.nett.npolar.
- Should point to *tool instructions* on hav.nett.npolar
- Need to add processing functions:
    - Outlier picker
    - Visualizers
    - Offset appliers
    - Cutters
- Probably need a RECORD or INTERNAL field (counting removed points, etc)!
- Need to have export-to-mat functions
- Need to test on as many .cnvs as possible
- *Should* have btl/salinometer stuff ready!
- Stress that this builds on Yannicks stuff..
